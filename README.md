Tic Tac Toe Game 

  Game Rules:
 
    1- A player must choose a cell from 1 to 9
          1|2|3
          4|5|6
          7|8|9
          
    2- Each player must choose either 'X' or 'O'
    
    3- The game will end if the cells are full
    
    4- 'x' player always goes first
 
 The Goal:
 The goal of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3x3 grid.
 
 What's Interesting ??
 
  1- Be careful. I have added a new rule, which is that any player ( X or O ) can remove the symbol of the other player.

  2- The last shape of the board will appear after the game.
 
  3- A file will show the players name and the scores.
 
 Hint: two expert players might draw :)
 
 will continue with the codes next time....
